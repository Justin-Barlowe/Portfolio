            <div class="about-section-2"><p>Welcome! I'm Justin Barlowe, a passionate web development student at Bellevue University, striving to hone my skills as a FullStack Developer. My enthusiasm for technology started early, evolving into a lifelong commitment. Back in 2008, my journey began when I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and PHP, creating engaging video game clan websites for Counter-Strike and Americas Army.</p>

            <p>Following high school, I served as a Combat Medic in the Army, all the while maintaining my interest in Web Development, Network Engineering, and Cybersecurity. Upon my departure from the Army in 2013, I found fulfillment in the medical field. I proceeded to Paramedic school and have since held a variety of roles over the past decade, including Paramedic, Paramedic Supervisor, Tactical Medic, and Medical Examiner.</p> </div>

Despite the years and my varied professional journey, my passion for the digital world never waned. I'm not just a web development enthusiast but also an avid gamer. Besides that, you can often find me at metal festivals, or experimenting with recipes in the kitchen.
